    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p><strong>Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel</strong> was born on August 19, 1883, in Saumur, France. 
    Her early life was far from glamorous — after her mother’s death, she spent much of her childhood in an orphanage, 
    where she learned to sew. This skill would later become the foundation of her empire.</p>

    <p>As a young woman, she worked as a cabaret singer in cafés and bars, where she earned the nickname “Coco.” 
    Despite her humble beginnings, Chanel’s ambition and taste for simplicity began to set her apart. 
    She started designing hats and gradually expanded her craft into clothing — marking the beginning of a fashion revolution.</p>
